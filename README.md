# MusicAppWinForm
A WinForm app to hold music Album data in a database.  Intended to refresh MVP design pattern and learn a few new things along the way.

If an experienced programmer would like to review my code (A winform with basic CRUD operations), implementing the MVP design pattern), then that would be awesome. I'm studying hard to convert from one type of job to a position of Junior Programmer. That is my motivation.
Notice that Form or GUI design is not the issue here. I just wonder if I'm doing coding-wise things right.
